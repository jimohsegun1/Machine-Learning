* **Classification:** This model is designed to predict a categorical outcome â€“ whether a wine is of "good quality" (1) or "bad quality" (0).

**Algorithm**

* **Random Forest Classifier:** 
    * This is an ensemble learning method. 
    * It constructs multiple decision trees during training. 
    * The final prediction is based on the majority vote (mode) of the predictions from the individual trees.

**Summary**

The code utilizes a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning algorithm, for binary classification of wine quality into "good" (1) and "bad" (0) categories.
