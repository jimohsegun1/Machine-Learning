**Objective**

The code aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. 

**Methodology**

* **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    * Loads a dataset of car information (`car_data.csv`) using pandas.
    * Features include: car age, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and selling price.
    * Preprocesses data: handles missing values and converts categorical features (e.g., fuel type) into numerical representations.

* **Model Training:**
    * Trains two machine learning models:
        * **Linear Regression:** Finds a linear relationship between car features and selling price.
        * **Lasso Regression:** Incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting.

* **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluates model performance using metrics like R-squared error.

* **Prediction:**
    * Uses the trained models to predict the selling price of new cars based on their features.

**Outcome**

* Develops a system capable of accurately predicting car prices.
* Provides valuable insights for car sellers, buyers, and pricing tools within car sales platforms.
